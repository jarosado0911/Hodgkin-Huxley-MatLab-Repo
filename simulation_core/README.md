% this is for running the simulation
% geomFolder: this the folder with the .swc refinement geometries
% the geomFolder would be something like: 
% 'D:\path_to_geometry_folder\geometryfolder
% refinements: enter as an array [0] or can be like [0,1,2,3] for refines
% 0 through 3
% mysave = 0 means do not save every time step data
% mysave = 1 means save every time step == using lots of memory!!
% outputFolder = name of folder where you want output to go, i.e.
% 'runCell228-13MG
